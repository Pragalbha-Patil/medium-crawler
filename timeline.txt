Plan:
	1. Identify how links can be fetched after taking tag as a parameter
	2. Identify what parts of the page to scrape after fetching page from the link found in step 1
	3. Identify how to store this data into a relational database for fetching
	4. Identify how data will be ultimately displayed on frontend 
Design:
	1. Design database for storing data
	2. Design admin page for displaying data
Implement:
	1. Setup Git, Flask, React & Database
	2. Code crawler to fetch links and articles based on tag
	3. Store crawled data into Database
	4. Fetch this data through APIs
	5. Display blog, search history on Admin panel
Test:
	1. Test crawler reliability by passing both valid and invalid tags
	2. Test Admin panel for querying the backend API and displaying the results
Deploy:
	1. Deploy Flask on heroku & React on Netlify.
